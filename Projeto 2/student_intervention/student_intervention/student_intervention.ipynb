    "\n",
    "**1-Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)**\n",
    "One real world application of Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB) is the classification of an email as spam/ not spam. The Naive Bayes assumption is that all the features are conditionally independent given the class label, even though this is usually false. This assumption allows the calculation of the probability of being spam given that we know the features (main words, spelling mistakes,...) within the email. The Bayesian classifier predicts that the e-mail belongs to class spam if the probability of the email have the determined features(certain words such as viagra, deal, and alsospelling mistakes) given that it is a spam email (posterior probability)be bigger than the probability of the email have the same determined features given that it is a no spam email.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Strengths of Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB):  It is easy to implemente, requires a small amount of training data to estimate the parameters, good results obtained in most of the cases, good computational efficiency and good performance for real-world problems. Studies comparing classification algorithms have found that the naive Bayesian classifier to be comparable in performance with decision tree and selected neural network classifiers. Bayesian classifiers have also exhibited high accuracy and speed when applied to large databases.\n",
    "    Weaknesses of Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB): the assumption of the class conditional independence, therefore loss of accuracy. Practically, dependencies exist among variables (for example, in hospitals the patients have in their profile age, family historic, symptoms, disease, and these have dependencies) and dependencies among these cannot be modelled by Naive Bayesian Classifier. So when features are not independent given the class label, naive Bayes will make wrong decisions. If the dependency between the features is too Strong, naive Bayes might perform poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "I belive that the naive bayes will perform reasonably once neither of the classes have a to small amoount of samples, even though some of the features might have dependencies. Also, the amound of the dataset seems to be sufficient to train the model. \n",

    "\n",
    "**2- Decision Trees**\n",
    "One real world application of decision trees classifier is the algorithm created to identify cosmic-ray hits in Hubble Space Telescope images. In this case, decision trees classifiers was producing results with over 95% accuracy using data from a single, unpaired image. The main goal of this classifier is to eliminate the noise that cosmic rays cause in the images taken by the telescope, which hinders the identification of stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Advantages of Decision Trees: This model can generate understandable rules, perform classification without much computation,\tcan also handle continuous and categorical variables and, finally,provide a clear indication of which fields are most important for prediction or classification. \n",
    "    Weaknesses of Decision Trees: Decision trees perform very poorly with datasets that have many classes and small data. It is not suitable for prediction of continuous attribute and is computationally expensive to train.It also do not treat well non-rectangular regions, for data including categorical variables with different number of levels, information gain in decision trees is biased in favor of those attributes with more levels ans calculations can get very complex, particularly if many values are uncertain and/or if many outcomes are linked.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this classification problem,the size of the dataset seems to be sufficient to make this model perform weel. In addition,most of the dataset variables look adequated and do not seem to have a dependency between eachother. Therefore, I consider that this model will perform nicely and give a good result.\n",

These analyses are important in order to avoid unnecessary chemotherapy or the cancer progression. Also, by analyzing diagnosed image biopsy even more features can be extract and used in the analysis, enriching the data and improving the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Strengths of Random Forest: As strengths, we have that this model is one of the most accurate learning algorithms available.  For many datasets, it produces highly accurate classifier. It performs efficiently on large databases and it can handle thousands of input variables without variable deletion. It performs pretty well on data where there is no strong relationship between the variables. It also gives estimates of what variables are important in the classification.\n",
    "    Weaknesses of Random Forest: The weaknesses of this model are that they have been observed to overfit for some datasets with noisy classification/ regression tasks. Also for data including categorical variables with different number of levels, random forests are biased in favor of those attributes with more levels. Therefore, the variable importance scores from random forest are not reliable for this type of data.  If the dataset have few examples and many variables, it will also not perform nicely.**\n",
    "    \n",
    "This model is a good candidate for this problem, once we have a good size of data set with many features, the dataset also does not seem to be noisy, most of the categorical variables have only two levels (binary) and the relationship among the variables does not seem to be strong. \n",

By analyzing the results given by all the models, without changing any parameter, the Decision tree has shown a good training time and a good prediction (test) time, which both are very close to the times measured in the GaussianNB, and way smaller than the RandomForestClassifier. Another nice characteristic to pinpoint is that, once the model has overfitted, presenting a F1 Score equals 1, it is possible do conclude that the model's performance can be  considerably improved by exploring its parameters and making it even better than the results of the other two models. Also, the GaussianNB does not have parameters that make its improvement results possible and it is less eaysier to interpret, which also make the Decision Tree more interesting to explore. Finally, comparing the cost of the Decision Tree and the Random Forest models, the Decision tree has a smallest processing cost, once is an easier and faster model to implement and train. \n",

We do this until we narrow the space of possibilities to one item, and by doing this continously we form branches that leads to different leaves, which represent the final answer of our questions. This first process consists on the learning process of our decision tree and, as we can see, this model works in a very transparent way, making it even better to understand in a deeper sense. \n",

    "**Answer: The final model's F1 Score for training and testing are, respectively, 0.8477 and 0.7972, which is a way better value than the result that we got with the untuned model, which was 1.000 and 0.6557 for the training and testing sets, respectively. The untuned model result clearly showed a overfitted model, indicating a high variance. It is also possible to see an improvement in the training time, even though the result previously shown was already good. \n",
    "Concluding, by seeing the results obtained throughout this project, it was possible to confirm and see in practice the importance of the analysis around the untuned model to diagnose the possible problems and try different approaches to make it better.**"
